# LiveCoding Using Processing 
#### Harshika Jain  x  Sisi Yu
We started out in this project seeking to explore interactions between music and visuals. The process included dabbling with multiple live coding softwares till we chanced upon REPL mode in Processing which allows for capabilities for Livecoding. We also sought for ways for our project to serve be open sourced and documented our process as a guide for others hoping to venture into the world of code generated visuals. 

## Research Question
Looking at new ways of interacting with music through user influenced visuals 
Exploring the future possibilities of user influence based on the music and audience input
Exploring how the audience can become part of the performance and influence the visuals created 
Creation of a feedback loop between the artist and the audience 
How the environment can start to respond back
